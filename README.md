## Project Overview
Use the public dataset for Citi Bike in New York City to help investors determine whether a similiar program in Des Moines, Iowa would be a successful venture.
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create visualizations with Tableau using Citi Bike data from August, 2019, to assist in the determination of whether or not a bikesharing program would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results - [Tableau Story Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jen.robert7492/viz/CitibikeChallenge_16396673254270/NYCCitibikeAnalysisOutcomes?publish=yes)

 - Checkout Times for Users:  The first visualization demonstrates the average trip duration for users during August, 2019.  We find the typical checkout time for each ride is about 5 minutes.  After that time, the trip duration continues to decline with fewer trips take that last greater than one hour.  We can reasonably conclude that bike sharing is most often used for quick trips and not for multiple hours.

 - Checkout Times by Gender:  Male users are the predominent client for Citi Bike.  Males have a typical bike checkout time of about 5 minutes.  Female users are significantly less than male users.  However, females have a typical checkout time of 6 minutes.  For users, where we do not the gender, the max checkout time is about 11 minutes.
